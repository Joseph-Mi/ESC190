/*
Wait a minute! This means linked lists are no better than
arrays, are they?
▶ Linked lists have one big advantage over arrays: their size is
not fixed and can grow and shrink to accommodate exactly
the number of values actually stored
▶ Linked lists are particularly suited to applications where we
mostly need to insert or remove values from either end of the
list—we’ll see examples soon, when we discuss stacks and
queues

//advanced data types
//stack
//implement as list or linked list

/*
push(elem): add elem to the top of the stack
pop(): return the elem from the top of the stack, and remove it
isEmpty(): return True iff stack is empty and element cannot be popped
